That money needs to be kept at our local schools. If people don’t want to attend their local schools, there are private schools. Charters repeatedly break the law by denying state and federal laws. They do not provide FAPE (free and appropriate public education) to all students. I know several families who have been told that their student “doesn’t fit their model.”  That is ILLEGAL and they should receive no public funds. They exclude poor test scores to look better on paper. Home school charters are also shady. They allow people to use their public funds to purchase DISNEYLAND SEASON PASSES!!! This is not uncommon and so wrong. Meanwhile, our beginning teachers with credentials and masters degrees qualify for food stamps based on income. Why aren’t we addressing this corruption?"

Charter schools were supposed to be an experiment whose successes would be then shared with Public Schools. Instead Charter Schools became a business unto themselves. With many for-profit companies taking over Charter Schools around the country, public schools are really in danger. Public schools for all were one of the great successes of this Country. We cannot let the Charter School Industry bring our Public Schools down. "

As a formerly charter school teacher for over 17 years, I admittedly have mixed feelings regarding charter schools in general and the literal explosion of them since the charter school legislation in the early 90's. While some charters are administered responsibility and serve a worthwhile purpose, too many are poorly run and uproot students and their families when they abruptly close. Throwing scarce tax dollars at poorly run public schools doesn't solve the problem either (emphasize on scarce). With those notable exceptions, the vast majority of public education is grossly underfunded (but are run remarkably well). Greatly increase  public school funding and hold all administrators more accountable. Money and accountability won't solve all of public school problems. Regaining the admiration and trust that's been lost over decades of decreased attention to our solemn oath as caretakers of our youth should be the main priority.  "

The enticements of charters cloak some of their less functional and truly undemocratic aspects, which families aren’t privy to.  There lies the true problem:  the public is privy to very little about the internal workings of charters, and that lack of oversight and transparency creates the pernicious double standard that is  working against the overall success of our public school system.  I am a product of a highly successful public school system, myself, and I know our cynicism about public ed in California is something we MUST overcome, by dedicating full resources and applying innovation to a great public education for ALL students.  Proud of my choice.  Ready to keep fighting."

 Charter schools currently do not have the same legal accountability as to how the school impacts traditional schools (Last year OUSD lost $57.3 million in a funding drain) and as to how local, state, and federal school funds are spent. Charter schools typically do not have teachers’ unions. This lack of oversight and accountability has attracted money and influence from wealthy individuals/corporate heads (Bloomberg of NYC, the Fishers of Gap, Hastings of Netflix, Eli Broad, the Waltons of WalMart, etc) outside of Oakland. More public schools are being closed and replaced by privately run charter schools. GO Public Schools was used as a conduit for hundreds of thousands of dollars pouring into state and local races such as the recent District 4 local school board election. The charter school billionaire backers' also attempted to unseat Tony Thurmond with the pro-charter candidate Marshall Tuck. 
In recent legislation AB 1840, our state legislators, Nancy Skinner, Rob Bonta and Tony Thurmond fought to get OUSD some fiscal relief, but with strict financial oversight and accounting controls in place. 
Please do your own research and be informed and assertive. Follow the money. Generate open conversation. Challenge the status quo. Education and our children's futures are not for sale. Schools should not be Big Business."

It is very important to sign the petition now because AB1505 is pending before the legislature right now and if your representative hears that you support this bill it may help to influence his/her vote.  I ask that you consider signing the petition  NOW to protect public education.  Thank you :)"

Charter schools have gone far beyond the scope of their original intent!  They must be scaled back and carefully scrutinized.   
 We must strengthen our public schools at every level with competent teachers, student support with counselors, psychologists, social workers, school nurses who can remove many barriers to academic success. We need to provide career development opportunities at every level!  We can do this!
